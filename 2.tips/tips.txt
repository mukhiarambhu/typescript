1. Duplicate identifier issues-
when another js file is created with same as of ts file after compiling typescript file, then we get duplicate identifier issue. //see intro/app.ts

// we can solve this issue using modular approach i.e by adding "export{}" at top of file, this will add "use strict" to js file

2.watch module-- 
if we see each time there is change in ts file every time we need to compile it to reflect change, to avoid this , to compile use this code "tsc <filename> --watch"

3. we can directly run js file using "node <filename>
4. if you noticed  "let" was use to declare a variable in typescript file but in javascript it was converted into "var" due to cross plateform compatibility.
